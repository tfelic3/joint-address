              <h4>Pandemic precautions</h4>
              President Joe Biden delivers his first speech to a joint session of Congress April 28. CDC guidelines and concerns about the coronavirus required deviating from tradition, making Biden’s address in the Chambers of the House of Representatives unlike any of his predecessors.</div>

              <h4>Fewer attendees</h4>
              Usually, there are more than 1,000 people in the House chamber. A maximum of 200 people may attend Biden’s national address. Lawmakers who do not receive an invitation from congressional leadership will not be allowed inside the Capitol after 5 p.m. ET on the day of the address. <p class='credit'>Credit: CNN</p></div>

              <h4>Two cabinet members</h4>Usually, 14 of the president’s 15 appointed cabinet leaders would assemble in the chamber. Only Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Gen. Lloyd Austin will be present this year.<br>

              <h4>No “designated survivor”</h4>Normally, a lone cabinet member remains in the care of the Secret Service outside of Washington D.C. to ensure the continuity of the government should someone attack the Capitol during the address where cabinet and congressional leaders would be present. With only two cabinet members in the chamber, that precaution is not necessary.<br>

However, Biden will not have guests who represent the president’s initiatives in her viewing box. Last year, Melania Trump hosted 21 people. Jill Biden will hold a virtual reception for her guests before the address, and they will watch the president’s speech remotely.  <p class='credit'>Credit: CNN/Pool</p></div>

              Historically, the president delivers a State of the Union speech in February. Biden’s first speech to a joint session is an “annual address,” and covid precautions led Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to delay inviting President Biden to address the body.<p class='credit'>Credit: CNN</p></div>
